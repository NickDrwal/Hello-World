# Hello-World
I am new to programming, and am currently using CodeAcademy to learn the basics. I used to code when I was younger on Notepad, creating simple interactive text games like "Zork." 
I would like to get into coding once again as I dearly miss it, and I strive to do some freelance web development and eventually land a full time job.
